Coldplay - 《 Yellow 》
Look at the stars; look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along; I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
Your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know?
You know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across; I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
Cos you were all yellow
I drew a line; I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
